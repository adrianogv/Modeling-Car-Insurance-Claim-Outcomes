{"cells":[{"source":"![car](car.jpg)\n\nInsurance companies invest a lot of [time and money](https://www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/pdf-84/accenture-machine-leaning-insurance.pdf) into optimizing their pricing and accurately estimating the likelihood that customers will make a claim. In many countries insurance it is a legal requirement to have car insurance in order to drive a vehicle on public roads, so the market is very large!\n\nKnowing all of this, On the Road car insurance have requested your services in building a model to predict whether a customer will make a claim on their insurance during the policy period. As they have very little expertise and infrastructure for deploying and monitoring machine learning models, they've asked you to identify the single feature that results in the best performing model, as measured by accuracy, so they can start with a simple model in production.\n\nThey have supplied you with their customer data as a csv file called `car_insurance.csv`, along with a table detailing the column names and descriptions below.","metadata":{},"id":"c3f0e974-faf8-458f-bf2a-06a469d0ea5e","cell_type":"markdown","attachments":{}},{"source":"\n\n## The dataset\n\n| Column | Description

examined various features related to car insurance claims, such as age, gender, driving experience, education, income, and vehicle characteristics, to determine their impact on the likelihood of a client making an insurance claim. After preprocessing the data, including handling missing values and performing logistic regression analysis on individual features, we identified driving experience as the most influential predictor with the highest model accuracy of 77.71%.\n\nThe analysis highlights key factors that correlate with claim behavior, providing valuable insights for insurance risk assessment and client profiling. This information can help insurers refine their risk prediction models and optimize premium rates. Further exploration using multivariate models and feature engineering could enhance prediction accuracy and offer a more comprehensive understanding of client claim patterns.\n\"\"\"","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":52,"lastExecutedAt":1731008874688,"lastExecutedByKernel":"6dc90646-b371-4975-9058-622489c8bd6b","lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"\"\"\"\"\nConclusion\nThis project examined various features related to car insurance claims, such as age, gender, driving experience, education, income, and vehicle characteristics, to determine their impact on the likelihood of a client making an insurance claim.
